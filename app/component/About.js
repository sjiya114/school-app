        <p className='pt-4 font-normal tracking-wide'>Our School Management Platform is designed to simplify the way schools are added, managed, and displayed online. With a clean and user-friendly interface,
             the system allows administrators to easily register schools by providing essential details such as name, address, city, state, contact information, images, and email ID.</p>
        <p className='pt-2 font-normal  tracking-wide'>The Add School feature enables institutions to quickly submit their details, while the All Schools section makes it easy for users to explore and discover registered schools in different locations. 
            The integrated Contact option ensures smooth communication between schools and interested users.</p>
        <p  className='pt-2 font-normal  tracking-wide'>
            Built with Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, and MySQL, the platform is optimized for performance, responsiveness, and scalability. 
            Whether itâ€™s for managing school listings, showcasing institutions, or streamlining communication, our project offers a secure and modern solution tailored for educational needs.
